# Juno User Manual

**Juno** is a lightweight, always-on-top floating quick-notes application designed to keep your thoughts organized without interrupting your workflow.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation
1.  Run the `Juno Setup 1.0.0.exe` installer.
2.  Follow the prompts to install Juno on your computer.
3.  Once installed, Juno will launch automatically.

### The Floating Ball
*   **Always on Top**: Juno appears as a small, unobtrusive floating ball on your screen.
*   **Move It**: Click and drag the ball to any position on your screen. It will stay there!
*   **Edge Docking**: Drag the ball to the left or right edge of the screen to "dock" it. It will hide most of itself to stay out of your way. Hover over it to undock.
*   **Open Notes**: Click the ball (or press `Ctrl+Shift+N`) to expand the full notes widget.

## ✨ Features

### 📝 Quick Notes

*   **Edit/Delete**: Hover over any note to see options to Edit (pencil icon) or Delete (trash icon).
*   **Edit Date/Time**: Click the date/time on any note card to quickly adjust the reminder.

### 📂 File Manager
Access the **Files** tab to manage your documents alongside your notes.
*   **Add Files**:
    *   Click the **"+"** button to select files from your computer.
    *   **Drag and Drop** files from your Desktop directly into Juno.

    *   **Rename**: Click the 3-dot menu on any file/folder and select "Rename" (type the new name and press Enter).
    *   **Drag to Folder**: Drag files onto a folder to move (or copy) them into it. Dropping a file onto a folder automatically opens it.

    *   **Drag Out**: You can drag files **FROM** Juno directly to your Desktop, or into a web browser (e.g., to upload to ChatGPT).
*   **Navigation**:

### ⏰ Reminders
Never forget a task! You can set a one-time reminder for any note.
1.  Click the **Calendar** icon to set a date.
2.  Click the **Clock** icon to set a time.
3.  When the time comes, Juno will send a system notification. Clicking the notification opens the app.

### 🎨 Themes
*   **Dark/Light Mode**: Open the **Settings** (gear icon) inside the widget to toggle between Dark and Light themes.

### ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts
*   **`Ctrl + Shift + N`**: Toggle the Juno window (Show/Hide) instantly from anywhere.
*   **`Esc`**: Collapse the widget back into the floating ball.

### 📥 System Tray
Juno runs in the background. Check your Windows System Tray (near the clock) for the Juno icon:
*   **Right-Click**: Access the menu to "Toggle Expand" or "Quit" the app.
*   **Double-Click**: Quickly show or hide the floating ball.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Q: The app disappeared!**
A: Check the System Tray (^ arrow near your clock). If the icon is there, double-click it. If not, relaunch Juno from the Start Menu.

**Q: I can't drag the window.**
A: You can only drag the **collapsed ball**. If the widget is expanded (showing notes), collapse it first by clicking the "Minimize" (-) button or pressing `Esc`.

**Q: Notifications aren't showing.**
A: Ensure your Windows "Focus Assist" or "Do Not Disturb" mode is off. Juno creates standard Windows notifications.
