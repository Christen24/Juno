## ✨ Features

### 📝 Quick Notes
*   **Create**: Type your note in the input box and press "Add Note".
*   **Colors**: Choose from 5 color codes (Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, White) to categorize your notes.

2.  Click the **Clock** icon to set a time.
3.  When the time comes, Juno will send a system notification. Clicking the notification opens the app.

### ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts
*   **`Ctrl + Shift + N`**: Toggle the Juno window (Show/Hide) instantly from anywhere.
*   **`Esc`**: Collapse the widget back into the floating ball.

### 📥 System Tray
Juno runs in the background. Check your Windows System Tray (near the clock) for the Juno icon:

*   **Double-Click**: Quickly show or hide the floating ball.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Q: The app disappeared!**
A: Check the System Tray (^ arrow near your clock). If the icon is there, double-click it. If not, relaunch Juno from the Start Menu.

**Q: I can't drag the window.**
A: You can only drag the **collapsed ball**. If the widget is expanded (showing notes), collapse it first by clicking the "Minimize" (-) button or pressing `Esc`.

**Q: Notifications aren't showing.**
A: Ensure your Windows "Focus Assist" or "Do Not Disturb" mode is off. Juno creates standard Windows notifications.
